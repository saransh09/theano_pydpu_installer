# theano_pydpu_installer
This is a shell script to install Theano, Keras and PyGPU for your system to run on GPU, I recently faced a lot of issues while trying to get PyGPU to work on my system for an old code. Therefore, I have written a shell script to install theano for python 2.7 in a virtual environment.
